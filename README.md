# What are Embeddings?

Word and sentence embeddings are a way to represent words and sentences in a computer-friendly format. They are used to capture the meaning of words and sentences so that computers can understand them better. Think of it like this: when we read a book, we understand the meaning of each word and how they relate to each other.This process of turning words and sentences into special codes or scores absed on their meaning is what we call embeddings. Therefore, word embeddings assign a score to each word based on how it relates to other words. For example, if we take the sentence “I like sleeping” and “I am too tired”, the word “sleeping” is related to “like” and “tired” is related to “am”. Word embeddings capture these relationships and assign scores to each word based on how they relate to other words. Sentence embeddings work in a similar way, but they assign scores to entire sentences instead of individual words. They are a powerful tool for making computers better at understanding human language. Here is an example of how word embeddings can be used: if we take the sentence “I like sleeping” and “I am too tired”, we can assign scores to each word based on how they relate to other words. The word “like” might have a score of 0.8 for “sleeping” and 0.2 for “tired”, while the word “am” might have a score of 0.8 for “tired” and 0.2 for “sleeping”. These scores can be used to determine the meaning of new sentences and how they relate to existing sentences.
